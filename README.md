## About
Read and write the chunks of RIFF and RIFX files.

## Install
```
npm install riff-chunks
```

## Browser
Use the compiled file in the */dist* folder:
```html
<script src="riff-chunks.min.js"></script>
```

Or get it from the [jsDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com) CDN:
```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/riff-chunks@6/dist/riff-chunks.min.js"></script>
```

## Example
```javascript
const riffChunks = require("riff-chunks");
const fs = require("fs");

let chunks = riffChunks.read(fs.readFileSync("file.wav"));
fs.writeFileSync("output.wav", riffChunks.write(chunks));
```

## API

## riffChunks.read()
```javascript
/**
 * Return the chunks of a RIFF/RIFX file.
 * @param {!Uint8Array|!Array<number>} buffer The file bytes.
 * @return {!Object} The RIFF chunks.
 */
function read(buffer) {}
```

**riffChunks.read()** returns a object like this:
```
{
    "chunkId": string,
    "chunkSize": number,
    "format": string,
    "subChunks": [
        {
            "chunkId": string,
            "chunkSize": number,
            "chunkData": Array<number>
        },
    ]
}
```

The **chunkData** field contains the raw bytes of the chunk data.

## riffChunks.write()
```javascript
/**
 * Pack a RIFF/RIFX file.
 * @param {!Object} chunks A object like the return of riffChunks.read().
 * @param {boolean} list An optional param indicating if the chunk is LIST.
 *      "LIST" chunks should not be rendered as Uint8Array.
 * @return {!Array<number>|!Uint8Array} The bytes as Uint8Array when chunkId is
 *      "RIFF"/"RIFX" or as Array<number> when chunkId is "LIST".
 */
function write(chunks) {}
```

## Distribution
This library is implemented as a ES6 module and also distributed as a CommonJS module, UMD module and a compiled script for browsers. If your system does not pick one automatically for you, you can pick one in the **dist/** folder.
- The CommonJS is the one used by Node. It is served in the "main" field of this library's package.json
- The UMD module is compatible with Node, AMD and browsers. It is served in the "browser" field.
- The compiled dist is browser-only and should be the one served by CDNs.
- The "module" field points to "./index.js" and should be the default entry point.

If you are using a module bundler to compile a module that depends on this library you might need to specify what is the correct entry point as some bundlers will assume "browser". In general, you should point to "module".

### webpack example:
```javascript
module.exports = {
  entry: './index.js',
  resolve: {
    // tells webpack to use 'module' or 'main'
    // not 'browser'
    mainFields: ['module', 'main']
  },
  ...
};
```
